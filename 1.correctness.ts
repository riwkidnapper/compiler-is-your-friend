The function will do as follows.

Given a string as an input, find the index of the string "Script" within the input string. 

You can use Google to look up the method calls.

Questions:
1) How to ensure that the input is a string at compile time?
2) What did you learn from this exercise?
*/

function scriptAt(word: string): number {
    return word.indexOf('Script');
}

console.log('scriptAt :>> ', scriptAt('type Script'));
